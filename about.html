            This is a simple website created for the Web Development course at BrainStation.
            The purpose of this website is to practice HTML and CSS skills. 
            The website includes information about the course, a link to today's class material, and a funny gif of a corgi typing fast on a laptop. 
            The website also includes a section with information about web development, HTML, and CSS. 
            The website was created by Elianna Bentz.
